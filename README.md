# prayer

This was my final project submission for Harvard's CS50 in December 2020. It's a [prayer drain](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Prayer#Prayer_drain) calculator for [Old School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/).

## Implementation

On the frontend, it uses JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, and (minimal) Bootstrap CSS. 
On the backend, it uses Python's Flask framework and the [OSRSBox module](https://www.osrsbox.com/projects/osrsbox-db/) API.

## Issues

The UI/UX has a lot of room for improvement; I was still very inexperienced with CSS and mostly concerned with making the backend functional.

The code itself also has a lot of room for improvement; it's very redundant and was written before I learned how to write elegant code.
